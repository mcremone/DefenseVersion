This template thesis directory is for Non-mac users. 

In "latex_tools/" I have provided a set of tools for compiling latex. In here you will find
the commands runlatex, runpdflatex and detex. 

detex:       Word counting of latex files
runlatex:    Runs 'latex'
runpdflatex: Runs 'pdflatex'

Use: runlatex thesis[.tex] -> extension optional

This will run 

latex thesis.tex
bibtex thesis.tex
latex thesis.tex
latex thesis.tex

And will then output some statistics about your thesis file. The file words.tmp is needed
for part of the stats, namely the word counting bit.


The "latex/" director should go in your home space as a ".latex/" directory, i.e.,
/home/username/.latex. The contents of this can then be added to a latex search path so
that if you download your own latex packages you can store them here. This way your
downloaded packages will automatically be picked so you don't have to have multiple copies
lying in various work directories.

In your .cshrch file add the following to set up the paths, swapping "username" with your
username.

# LaTeX search path
# ** IMPORTANT **
# The trailing colon indicates the standard search
# path should be appended to the user specified
# TEXINPUT variable
# Double trailing slash indicates this directory is
# to be search recursively
setenv TEXINPUTS ".:/home/username/.latex//:"
setenv BSTINPUTS ".:/home/username/.latex//:"
#setenv BIBINPUTS ".:/home/username/.latex//:"
 

Suggested thesis structure (i.e., the one contained in this tarball) looks something like
this (although ultimately it is up to you!).
